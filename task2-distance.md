# Task 2 - Find the distance

Mr. Harrison is planning a road trip through California. Luckily he has found a single road that connects the 5 cities he would like to visit.

The 5 cities (labelled A to E) that he will visit are as follows:

- A. San Diego - (Start)
- B. Los Angeles
- C. San Jose
- D. San Francisco
- E. Sacramento - (Finish)

When using the road, the distance from A (San Diego) to B (Los Angeles) is **205 km**. The distance from B to C is **547 km**. C to D is **78 km**. Finally, the distance from D to E is **141 km**.

Mr Harrison would like a way of quickly checking the distance between any 2 cities he will visit on his trip, he refuses to travel on any other road.

Write a program that will calculate and output a table showing the distance between all of the cities.

For example, your output may look something like this:
```
  |   A     B     C     D     E
---------------------------------
A |   0km 205km 752km 830km 971km
B | 205km   0km 547km 625km 776km
C | 752km 547km   0km  78km 219km
D | 830km 625km  78km   0km 141km
E | 971km 776km 219km 141km   0km
```
